    <h1>CRICKET</h1>
    <h2>How to play cricket</h2>
    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players. Each team takes turns batting and fielding. The aim of the game is to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets, while the opposing team fields and tries to get the batsmen out. The team that scores the most runs wins the match.</p>
    <p>There are three main formats of cricket: Test cricket, One Day International, and Twenty20. Test cricket is the longest format, with matches lasting up to five days. One Day Internationals are shorter, with each team facing a maximum of 50 overs (300 balls). Twenty20 is the shortest format, with each team facing a maximum of 20 overs (120 balls).</p>

    <h1> HISTORY OF CRICKET</h1>
    <p> The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century. Having originated in south-east England, it became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport after association football (soccer).[1]

        Internationally, cricket is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over one hundred countries and territories in membership although only twelve currently play Test cricket.
        
        The game's rules are defined in the "Laws of cricket". The game has various formats, ranging from one-day cricket played over a few hours to Test matches which can last up to five days.</p>
