    <h1>ICE HOCKEY</h1>
    <h2>How To Play Ice Hockey</h2>
    <p>Ice hockey (or simply hockey) is a team sport played on ice skates, usually on an ice skating rink with lines and markings specific to the sport. It belongs to a family of sports called hockey. In ice hockey, two opposing teams use ice hockey sticks to control, advance and shoot a closed, vulcanized, rubber disc called a "puck" into the other team's goal. Each goal is worth one point. The team which scores the most goals is declared the winner. In a formal game, each team has six skaters on the ice at a time, barring any penalties, one of whom is the goaltender. Ice hockey is a full contact sport.

        Ice hockey is one of the sports featured in the Winter Olympics while its premiere international amateur competition, the IIHF World Championships, are governed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) for both men's and women's competitions. Ice hockey is also played as a professional sport.
        
        In North America as well as many European countries, the sport is known simply as hockey. However, in other countries, "hockey" usually refers to field hockey. In 1994 hockey was officially recognized as Canada's national winter sport. </p>

      <h1> HISTORY OF ICE HOCKEY</h1>
      <P>Ice hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, Ireland, and elsewhere, primarily bandy, hurling, and shinty. The North American sport of lacrosse was also influential.
        
        
        Arguably the games most influential to the early design of ice hockey were early forms of an organized sport today known as bandy, a sport distinctly separate from ice hockey. These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules developed, such as shinny and ice polo, but would later be absorbed into a new organized game with codified rules which today is ice hockey.

        The origin of ice hockey was bandy, a game that has its roots in the Middle Ages. Just as for practically all other sports, the game of bandy achieved its modern form during the 19th century in England, more exactly in the Fen district on the East coast. From the Fen district the game was spread to London and from London to the Continent during the second half of the 19th century. British soldiers stationed in eastern Canada brought the game to the North American continent in the 1850s and '60s. You could find similar games there, played by immigrants (chiefly Dutch) and by Indians.
        
        Thus there were a number of different games played on skates with a stick and ball and with varying rules in America before ice hockey was invented.

    <h1> RULES AND REGULATIONS</h1>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Legal teams are 5 skaters and a goalie. Players may play on only one team. If teams compete with "borrowed" players, the game is recorded as a forfeit for the short-handed team. </li>
        <li>  All Leagues: Games are 30 minute straight play. The clock will start at game time.</li>
        <li> No over-time during the regular season; tie games will be recorded as such.</li>
        <li> No slap shots (shots taken from above the waist) at all - not during warm-ups or games.</li>
        <li> Offside & icing is called in the Granite League only. No offside in Green, Moosilauke or Women's Leagues. </li>
        <li>No checking of any kind. </li>
        <li> Checking is any intentional body contact that causes a clear change in skating direction or impedes the progress of a player with or without possession of the puck. 
            
            This includes but is not limited to any intentional body contact that causes a player to lose possession of the puck or any contact with players away from the puck that hinders their normal movement.</li>
        
    </ul>
