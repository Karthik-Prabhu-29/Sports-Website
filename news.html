While the tourists played aggressively and seemed on track for a 1-0 series lead, bad light forced the umpires to declare the result as a draw.<br><br>Speaking at the post-match presentation, Babar said Pakistan were keen for a result. The 28-year-old heaped praise on Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Wasim for playing positively when the hosts ran the risk of losing.<br><br>"As you know, we wanted to get a result, as I said at the toss, and we went for the declaration. But the light was not good enough, so it ended in a draw. Our fifth bowler is Salman Agha, he wasn't been feeling well. We missed him with the ball. So, I think our five-bowler attack is good. Wasim and Saud brought us back into the match. Credit to them for playing positive cricket."<br><br>Wasim joined hands with Shakeel when Pakistan were teetering at 208-7 with their lead of only 32. The pair put on a 71-run stand to extend Pakistan's lead to over 100 runs. The Kiwis declared with a first-innings lead of 174 after bowling Pakistan out for 438.

The prodigal opening batter has been snubbed by the national side of late despite prolific numbers in domestic cricket.<br><br>Shaw made his Team India debut at the age of 19 after leading the nation to victory in the U-19 World Cup in 2018. He scored a century in his maiden outing and was on the radar as a backup opener as well.<br><br>However, an injury ahead of his first overseas tour in Australia and an ensuing year-long ban from the sport after failing a drug test pushed his career back.<br><br>While he has arguably redeemed himself with his performances, he has only been able to amass a handful of appearances since then.<br><br>Analyzing the debacle surrounding Shaw's selection snub, especially in the workload management era where bench players are tried and tested out explicitly, Gambhir said on Star Sports:<br><br>"What are coaches there for? What are selectors there for? Not just to select the team or probably do those throwdowns and make them ready for the game. Ultimately, it is the selectors, the coaches and the management, who should try and get these guys, especially someone like a Prithvi Shaw, on the right track."<br><br>He continued:<br><br>"That is one of the jobs of the management is. It is not only about preparing them for a game or helping them in the practice sessions. If that is the case, whether it is Rahul Dravid or the national selection chairman should have a word with him and show him the clarity and probably keep him around the group."<br><br>Shaw's last international appearance came in July 2021 during the tour of Sri Lanka. He made his T20I debut during the tour and was dismissed for a first-ball duck

                    <!-- enter news -->Former Indian opener Gautam Gambhir reckons there shouldn't be any doubts about Ishan Kishan opening the batting alongside Rohit Sharma in ODI cricket. Gambhir believes Kishan's double hundred against Bangladesh in Mirpur makes him the frontrunner for the role.<br><br>Kishan, who replaced Rohit Sharma for the third ODI against Bangladesh earlier this month, cracked the fastest double hundred in the format. The left-handed batter became the fourth Indian batter to hit a double ton in ODIs. He achieved this in 126 balls, helping the visitors reach 409 in 50 overs.<br><br>Speaking on ESPN Cricinfo, the 41-year-old revealed he is surprised to see that people are still debating whether Ishan Kishan should open. The Delhi-born former cricketer also noted that the 24-year-old can keep wickets and said:<br><br>"I'm amazed we're discussing this because someone's got a double-hundred in the previous innings. The discussion is over. It has to be Ishan Kishan. Someone who can get a double-hundred in those conditions against a reasonable attack - especially at their home - should play."He got what 200 by the 35th over mark? You can't look at anyone beyond Ishan Kishan."<br><br>Gambhir continued:<br><br>"He has to be given a longer run. He can also keep wickets as well, so he can do two jobs for you. If someone else had got a double hundred, I think we would've gone gung-ho over that individual, but it's not the case with Ishan Kishan. Because we still continue to talk about other players. For me, that debate is over."<br><br>The selectors have also dropped Rohit's long-time opening partner Shikhar Dhawan from the ODI squad to face Sri Lanka following a poor run of form. Instead, Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan remain in the frame to bat at the top alongside Rohit, with the latter's 131-ball 210 making him the favorite.<br><br>"You've got to give a young boy at least one chance or a couple of chances" - Gautam Gambhir opines on Prithvi ShawGautam Gambhir.<br><br>Gambhir further claimed that a youngster like Prithvi Shaw deserves guidance in the right direction after a disciplinary issue in 2019 and a failed fitness test in March.

                    <!-- enter news -->Two days before he met Pele, the ‘Greatest One’ Muhammad Ali leaned back on the ropes after being pounded by the challenger Ernie Shavers in New York. ’Gruesome, Barbarically-riveting,’ the journalist Frank Keating would write. As he lay there, beside him, in tears, was Bundini Brown, Ali’s famous sidekick, the originator of ‘float like butterfly, sting like bee’ line and who would eventually fall out of inner circle after he sold Ali’s championship belt to a barber for 500$. The 35-year old Ali would stir from the ropes to say, “I am tired, I am tired, that’s it: The End”. Still in the ring, he would comb his hair on live television and shortly after washing up, Ali would tell reporters: ‘Well, 10 million dollars might force me out for one more fight”. Unfortunately, he would fight four more times, including the 1980 battering he took from the fist of Larry Holmes believed to have caused him brain damage.<br><br>Luckily that week in New York, another ‘Greatest’ Pele had decided to call it a day for good. Ali would be there to meet him for the first time, even as New York and the world bid goodbye to Pele. Both had come from deprived upbringing, two supreme black athletes, one a poster boy for anti-establishment, and the other for the establishment, but that day, the two stars drifted close to gape at each other.<br><br>Pele had come to play in the US for Cosmos, as the story goes, coaxed by the American politician Henry Kissinger. In truth, he needed the money.

On Day 4 of the third round fixture, Mumbai needed 62 runs to win while Saurashtra needed two wickets at the MCA-BKC ground.<br><br>And as the play got underway on Friday, Saurashtra took only 30 minutes to take the remaining two wickets and went home with six points. After drawing their first two matches, this was Saurashtra’s first win of the season and they are third in the table with 12 points behind Mumbai (13) and Maharashtra (13).<br><br>Jayesh Odedra, a former Saurashtra player and now coach of the team, was lost for words as he couldn’t believe that his team had beaten Mumbai in their own den despite missing Jaydev Unadkat and Cheteshwar Pujara. To put things in perspective as to how much the win meant to Odedra, at the end of the game he went to the pitch and took a pinch of mud and kept it in his pocket.<br><br>Later in the day, Odedra was emotional speaking about the special win. “It’s a pretty emotional, special moment. We talked about it yesterday (Thursday), we tried to get data from the Saurashtra Cricket Association as well. To my knowledge, no team from Saurashtra has scored an outright win against Mumbai. It was a really good team effort where each and every individual contributed. We were missing our star players — Pujara and Unadkat — but we had self-belief and unity. I still can’t get out of it. I even took some mud from the wicket (here), because I know that it’s a big thing when you win against Mumbai in Mumbai,” Odedra said
